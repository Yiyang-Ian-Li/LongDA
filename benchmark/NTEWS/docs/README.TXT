PUBLIC USE 2022 NATIONAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND WORKFORCE SURVEY PILOT DATA FILES

This download file contains data and related documentation for the public use 2022 National
Training, Education, and Workforce (NTEWS) Pilot data files. 

The estimates included in the NTEWS Pilot data files are not official statistics and should not be used
to make official statements or inferences about characteristics of the population or economy.  

The NTEWS is in a pilot phase. Survey methods including data collection and post data collection
processing are being evaluated and comprehensive quality measures are not available. These 2022
NTEWS Pilot data files are designated as an experimental statistical product. NCSES experimental
statistics and experimental statistical products are created to benefit users in the absence of other
relevant information and are developed using innovative and exploratory methodologies. These data
files are published to engage data users and other stakeholders in the survey’s development to improve
quality for future iterations of the survey. Experimental statistical products may not meet some of
NCSES’s quality standards and, as a result, users should assess the utility limitations of these
experimental statistics relative to the intended use. More information about the NCSES quality
standards is available on the NCSES quality and transparency website.
